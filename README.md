### Building with Vagrant

[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) along with a suitable virtual machine system (such as Oracle VirtualBox) can be used to simply build and deploy the FORGEStore
and all its dependencies.  This is particularly useful for development and testing.

If you are familiar with vagrant then just rename either execute `vagrant up`. Further instructions are provided in the documentation.
